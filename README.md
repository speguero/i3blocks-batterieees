`batterieees` is a battery status indicator script for the `i3blocks` status bar.

Upon invocation, the script determines the overall percentage and state of one or more batteries present within a machine and presents that information to a user in a simple format.

<span style="background-color: yellow; color: black;"><u>**However**, it must be noted that this script does **not** provide "*remaining time*" data, as such data becomes comically inaccurate when two or more batteries are involved.</u></span>
